## 🚀 About Me

I am a Data Engineer with a unique background that blends Finance (M.Sc.) with strong technical expertise in data platforms and software engineering. I don't just write scripts; I build scalable, production-grade data products and platforms.

My journey started in finance, but I quickly realized that the real challenge—and my true passion—lies in the data itself. Bridging the gap between business requirements (numbers, finance, reporting) and technical implementation (data pipelines, cloud infrastructure, automation) is where I thrive.

Currently, I work at **Solita** as a Data Engineer, focusing on modern AI-augmented development, DataOps, and building robust Azure-based data platforms.

Streamlined processes and improved reporting capabilities through a comprehensive Azure-based platform.
*   **Key actions:** Created Azure data services, implemented robust user management/security, optimized data streaming.
*   **Tech Stack:** Azure Data Factory, Databricks, DevOps, PySpark, Python, Alation.

### **Data Migration & GenAI-Accelerated Refactoring** (Large Pension Insurance Company)
*Role: Data Engineer | Jan 2023 - Aug 2025*

**The Challenge:**
Migrate 100+ legacy Databricks notebooks to new data sources and ensure 100% data consistency without stalling development.

**The Solution:**
Developed a custom test bench for automated regression testing and utilized GenAI augmented workflows to systematically refactor code at speed.
*   **Key actions:** Automated data validation between old and new flows. Utilized a systematic **Agentic Development Methodology** (Markdown-based Kanban for Agent Coordination, precise Role Definition, TDD) to maintain strict quality control and prevent project sprawl during rapid AI-assisted refactoring.
*   **Tech Stack:** Databricks, Python, PySpark, Automated Testing.

### **GenAI-Augmented Migration Pipeline POC** (Legacy ETL to dbt)
*Role: Lead Architect (POC)*

**The Challenge:**
Explore the feasibility of automating the migration of complex legacy Informatica workflows to modern dbt models to reduce manual refactoring effort.

**The Solution:**
Designing and partially implementing a semi-automated migration pipeline. The system processes legacy workflows one by one, utilizing GenAI to interpret transformation logic and generate compliant dbt code.
*   **Outcome:** Validated the feasibility of AI-driven legacy code modernization.
*   **Tech Stack:** GenAI, dbt, Python, legacy ETL systems.

### **Regulatory Data Integration (EUDR Compliance)**
*Client: Global Bioforestry Company | Role: Senior Integration Specialist | 2025*

**The Challenge:**
To comply with the new EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), the client needed to attach specific traceability numbers to transport orders. The goal was to replace error-prone manual updates with a fully automated, auditable system.
